This project is a "virtual library" that allows you to search up books using Google's Book API and save them to your booklist. Each book has a short description and author information.

To run:

Run terminal (terminal > new terminal)
cd book-finder-app
npm install
npm run dev

I faced quite a few challenges when creating this project. Initially, I wanted to use a frog/adoption API for my previous website, but finding a suitable API was quite difficult. Many adoption or animal database API's required sign-ups and copious amounts of information before an API Key was granted. So, I decided to scrap that idea and go for a simple virtual bookshelf after finding several free book database API's.

This also proved to be a challenge because it was difficult to find a book API that worked with the project I had in mind. Some didn't have any description or author information so I needed to find one that was good enough for the project needs. I had restarted around 2 times before I gave up and put it away for another day.

Eventually, I saw that the Google Books API had all the information I needed, but I had to go through their confusing cloud services page to get a key. After finally getting a key, I could start creating my virtual library. It was going well, but at the end I reached my API Key limit and I was unable to fetch information after a certain point.

I had to come back later when the limit reset to make more progress until I finally finished the assignment.
